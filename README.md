# DevOps with Docker course

This repository includes my submissions for the course DevOps with Docker. By far I have completed the first part of the course. 

First part includes:
- Running containerized applications
- Containerizing applications
- Utilizing volumes to store data persistently outside of the containers.
- Using port mapping to enable access via TCP to containerized applications
- Sharing own containers publicly
