## Exercise 1.6

I first searcher for "devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise" in Docker hub. From the images [README](https://hub.docker.com/r/devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise) I found the viable input, which is "basics".

On terminal I run this command and gave "basics" as the password:
```
sudo docker run -it devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise
Give me the password: basics
```

Which gave me the output:

_You found the correct password. Secret message is:
"This is the secret message"_
